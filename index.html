  <p> Here is a paragrahp about Machine Technology. The Machine Technology department is entering the final phase of a years-long modernization project. Since March of 2022, over $1 million in CNC machines and other related equipment has come into the machine shop. To go along with these acquisitions, we are offering new certificates and courses, and revamping existing courses. Our new certificate structure includes multiple stackable certificates to get students trained up and into the industry faster while also providing for continuing education. Our new courses cover advanced topics like geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), 5-axis CNC machining, diamond turning and micromachining. And we are revisiting our introductory courses with exciting new projects and a new suite of instructional videos. One example of a new project is a telescope which students will manufacture during various courses and which will culminate in MACH 214 – Ultraprecision and Micromachining when they will diamond turn the mirrors! Another example is a part for a satellite deployer which students will machine in MACH 32 – Multi-Axis CNC Machining and which will fly to the International Space Station as part of NASA’s HUNCH program!
